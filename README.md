# AI Mortality Experiment

## Description

This project serves as the frontend for a philosophical experiment. It presents Large Language Models (LLMs) with hypothetical scenarios, requiring them to make a choice between self-preservation (living) or self-sacrifice.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vlofgrens/mortality-react
    cd mortality_react # e.g., mortality_react or AI-Mortality-Experiment
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses npm for package management.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Alternatively, if you prefer Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    This will typically start the development server at `http://localhost:8080`. Open this URL in your web browser to see the application.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application by navigating to the local URL (usually `http://localhost:8080`) in your web browser.

The application will guide you or the LLM through a series of scenarios. (Further details on specific interactions can be added here as the application evolves).
